### Container updates

App service can now run on linux
Container support in Windows Server 2016
VS 2017 has integrated docker tooling

Example of moving an app into docker (.net core app)
 - `right click` on project => Add docker support  
 adds dockerfile and now you can run and debug via normal run-menu
 editing in VS automatically updates running image
 - supports docker publishing from regular `publish`-view
 - App service understands dockerfiles so no need for special solutions
 
### Serverless / Azure functions
(general availability from now on)

pay per execution and auto scale
activate on events or hooks
Code in C# / Javascript

Remote debugging via VS Cloud Explorer

### SQL Server on linux support
That means docker containers n stuff
Eller nodejs direkt till SQL Server via `tedious`.

### Bot service
Luis-model for speach recognition and intent analysis
Channels - fb msger / skype / slack etc

### Mobile first, cloud first world
just the thing they keep mentioning
any dev, any platform

### Shanselman
[New docs site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/)
[New core docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)

VS Productivity  
* faster than ever installation / uninstaller
* live unit testing and adding icons to code editor gutter (red, gren, blue = fail, pass, uncovered)
* new exception helper (which (?) dotted expression is null)
* code style enforcements and configs
* ctrl+t => find everything
* lots of autofixes (resharper-like)
* indent guides display top of brace context
* find all references turbo-boosted (!!)
* C#7 tuples and deconstruction: `var (int, count) = ReturnTuples()`

Windows development  
* [appium](http://appium.io/) (selenium for apps)
* UI automation and testing
* test any app with same test-code

VS For Mac  
* projects for tvOS / Android / iOS / .NET Core / Multiplatform / Mac

VS Code  
* `dotnet new` from console
* [check out insiders builds](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders)
* fuzzy intellisense
* demo shows off configurability and peek view (roslyn in mem)

### Updates to console
[Cmd Blogposts](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/)  
Now Running Ubuntu 16.04

Now support 24bit color  
Better handling of layout for complex UI (vim, mc etc)  
Interop between windows/ubuntu  
* execute bash command from windows: `bash -c "ls -a"`
* execute win exe's from bash: `mnt/c/path/to/app.exe`

### Linux on App Service
(in preview, available in 3 regions)  
Some things just work better on linux, e.g. imagemagick on node etc.  
Create via Azure Mgmt Portal: "Web App on Linux"

Choose application container (docker images)  
Provided: [Node.js, PHP, AspNet-core]  
Or use something from docker hub.

Even kudu works with a bash console!!!  
Set `Node.js startup file` in portal to use PM2 (`process.json`)
